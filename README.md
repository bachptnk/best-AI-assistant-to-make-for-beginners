# best-AI-assistant-to-make-for-beginners

I TRIED SO HARD TO MAKE THIS ASSISTANT (I AM A STUDENT IN GRADE 10)
I am learning in HIGH SCHOOL FOR THE GIFTED - VNU HCM (Vietnamese name of the school: PTNK)

I MYSELF MADE this assistant.

It can work totally offline and recognize sound really well
It can work online too
